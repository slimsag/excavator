## What is this about?

I'm making an excavator. Yep, like a literal excavator:

But.. smaller, of course.

## Why make an excavator?

1. *They're cool!*
2. *Remote controlled things are cool!*
3. Why not?

## The PEPDOT stack

This project involves so many things..

- **Pneumatics**: Compressors, piping, cylinders, solenoid valves, etc.
- **Electronics**: Circuitry, raspberry pi's, stepper motors, etc.
- **Programming**: Microcontroller interfacing, web UX, HTTP servers, etc.
- **Design**: Model design, 3D printing, planning, etc.
- **Originality**: Coming up with solutions to problems that... are just _not really on the internet_!
- **Trial.. and a whole lot of error!**
