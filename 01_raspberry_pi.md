# Raspberry Pi

Onboard the vehicles outline in this project, a Raspberry Pi is used. You can use any revision of the Raspberry Pi, but the GPIO pin layout may be different (check if you use a different revision).

You will also need a micro SD card (pick up whatever is cheapest, any size will do).
