# GPIO expansion board

The Raspberry Pi 3 by default has 24 usable GPIO pins. This means you can e.g. turn on and off 24 unique circuits (e.g. an LED).

For this project, we use a lot of GPIO pins. More than the Raspberry Pi allows for on its own. We use this expansion board:

- [SainSmart Raspberry Pi Infinity Cascade RPI GPIO Expansion Board IO Extend Adapter Module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YXHIZTY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

With the use of this board, you can use up to 32 GPIO pins (it gives you 8 additional ones).

(Note: the Amazon reviews are poor because it lacks good instructions, but we provide those here)
